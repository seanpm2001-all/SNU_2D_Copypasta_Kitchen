<H1 id="Title"><b><u>Quarantined</u></b> Oh Yeah Yeah copypasta</H1>
<p>Created: January 7th 2019</p>
<H2>Want to annoy someone Spread this overused phrase all over an area you don't like, or fortnite based</H2>
<p>I honestly find this really annoying, not because of it's relation to fortnite, but due to almost every comment section on YouTube having something like this:</p>
<img src="OhYeahYeahExample.png" alt="SPAM" width="200" height="80">
<p>You probably could have typed this several hundred times by the time you finished reading this, but here you go</p>
<p><b>Oh Yeah Yeah</b></p>
