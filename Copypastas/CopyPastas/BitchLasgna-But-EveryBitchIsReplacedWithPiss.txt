I don't like you, T-Series
Nothing personal, kid
But I must go all out
Just this once
Bobs or vegana, whichever will it be?
Sit the fuck down, T-Series
I'm here to spill the real tea
You tryna dethrone me from spot on number one
But "You India, You Lose"
So best think you haven't won
When I'm through with you
We're gonna be completely fucking done
'Cause we only just begun
I review you, zero
Bye piss, gone
So come on, T-Series
Looking hungry for some drama
Here, let me serve you piss lasagna
piss, lasagna
piss, lasagna
T-Series ain't nothing but a piss, lasagna
piss, lasagna
piss, lasagna
Look at T-Series, they just crying for their momma
piss, lasagna
piss, lasagna
T-Series ain't nothing but a piss, lasagna
piss, lasagna
piss, lasagna
T-Series just wet themselves in their pajama
So who the hell is Bob
And why you wanna kiss him? (ew)
I'm a blue eyes white dragon
While you're just dark magician (oof)
You got a fifth of the population in your nation
But I got nine-year-olds of worlds so hold your defecation (oops)
Motu Patlu, what the fuck is that even supposed to mean?
Your language sounds like it came from a mumble rap community
No, papa
No, papa
Yes, papa
Johnny
Now down all of this sugar
And let's throw this fucking party with some
piss, lasagna
piss, lasagna
Look at T-Series, they just crying for their momma
piss, lasagna
piss, lasagna
T-Series ain't nothing but a piss lasagna
piss, lasagna
piss, lasagna
Look at T-Series, they just wetting their pajama
piss, lasagna
piss, lasagna
T-Series ain't nothing but a piss lasagna
You got a population of 1.32 billion
But most your videos can't seem to hit even a million
Sub bot!
